Project 2 Report for CS 347
1) The Experience of Installation

I chose the default configuration options, such as the default port and automatic
service startup, when I installed MySQL Community Server using the official installer.
After the installation was successful, I was able to use MySQL Workbench and the 
command-line interface to connect to the server right away. During setup, I had no problems. 
Without requiring any extra setup, MySQL Workbench installed without any issues and 
identified the local server. Using localhost and the default port (3306), I established 
a local connection, and everything went according to plan.

2) Sakila-database.sql observations
The Sakila database's structure is specified in the sakila-database.sql file. 
The schema, tables (including actor, movie, customer, rental, and payment), 
primary keys, foreign key constraints, indexes, views, stored procedures, and 
triggers are all created by it. In order to preserve data integrity, this 
script creates the entire database structure and enforces table relationships.

3) Notes regarding sakila-data.sql
Using numerous INSERT statements, the sakila-data.sql file adds sample data to 
the database. To guarantee that related records are created correctly, the data 
is inserted in a sequence that complies with foreign key constraints. This script 
adds realistic data to the previously defined schema, enabling instant 
testing of database operations and queries.
